# Voice Assistant Project

## Overview
This project involves creating a **Voice Assistant** capable of responding to user commands, providing information, and performing tasks. The assistant can be implemented in two versions: **Basic** and **Advanced**, catering to beginners and advanced developers respectively.

---

## Features

### Basic Version
- **Greeting Response**: Responds to greetings like "Hello."
- **Time and Date Information**: Tells the current time and date.
- **Web Search**: Searches the web for user queries.

### Advanced Version
- **Weather Updates**: Fetches real-time weather information.
- **Email Sending**: Sends emails based on voice input.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Interprets complex user queries.
- **Task Automation**: Sets reminders and performs automated tasks.
- **Third-party API Integration**: Enhances functionality with external services (e.g., weather, news, or smart home devices).

---

## Key Technologies

### Libraries and APIs
- **Speech Recognition**: Captures and processes voice commands.
- **pyttsx3**: Converts text to speech for vocal responses.
- **datetime**: Provides date and time information.
- **webbrowser**: Opens web pages for search queries.
- **requests**: Fetches data from external APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- **smtplib**: Sends emails via SMTP.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Required libraries: `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `requests`, `datetime`, `webbrowser`, `smtplib`
- Microphone for voice input
- Internet connection for online functionalities

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anam-Ali-2308/voice-assistant.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd voice-assistant
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Assistant
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Interact with the assistant by speaking into the microphone.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Commands
- **"Hello"**: The assistant responds with a greeting.
- **"What time is it?"**: Provides the current time.
- **"Search for Python tutorials"**: Opens a web browser with Google search results.

### Advanced Commands
- **"What's the weather in Paris?"**: Provides the current temperature and weather description in Paris.
- **"Send an email"**: Guides the user through composing and sending an email.

## Key Concepts and Challenges

### Speech Recognition
- Utilize the `speech_recognition` library to capture and interpret voice commands.
- Handle challenges like background noise and unclear pronunciation.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Advanced)
- Improve interaction by interpreting varied ways of expressing the same command.
- Consider libraries like `nltk` or `spaCy` for enhanced NLP capabilities.

### Task Automation
- Leverage APIs like OpenWeatherMap for weather data.
- Implement email sending via `smtplib` securely.

### Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling for voice recognition failures and network issues.

### Privacy and Security
- Secure sensitive data like email credentials with environment variables or configuration files.

---

## Customization
- Add custom commands by modifying the `main()` function.
- Integrate additional APIs to extend functionality (e.g., news updates, sports scores).

---

## Roadmap
1. Implement more advanced NLP features for improved understanding.
2. Add voice-based authentication for security.
3. Integrate smart home device control using IoT.
